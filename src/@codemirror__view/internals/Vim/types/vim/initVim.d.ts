/**
 * Supported keybindings:
 *   Too many to list. Refer to defaultKeymap below.
 *
 * Supported Ex commands:
 *   Refer to defaultExCommandMap below.
 *
 * Registers: unnamed, -, ., :, /, _, a-z, A-Z, 0-9
 *   (Does not respect the special case for number registers when delete
 *    operator is made with these commands: %, (, ),  , /, ?, n, N, {, } )
 *   TODO: Implement the remaining registers.
 *
 * Marks: a-z, A-Z, and 0-9
 *   TODO: Implement the remaining special marks. They have more complex
 *       behavior.
 *
 * Events:
 *  'vim-mode-change' - raised on the editor anytime the current mode changes,
 *                      Event object: {mode: "visual", subMode: "linewise"}
 *
 * Code structure:
 *  1. Default keymap
 *  2. Variable declarations and short basic helpers
 *  3. Instance (External API) implementation
 *  4. Internal state tracking objects (input state, counter) implementation
 *     and instantiation
 *  5. Key handler (the main command dispatcher) implementation
 *  6. Motion, operator, and action implementations
 *  7. Helper functions for the key handler, motions, operators, and actions
 *  8. Set up Vim to work as a keymap for CodeMirror.
 *  9. Ex command implementations.
